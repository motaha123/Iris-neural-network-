# Iris-neural-network-
neural network model is designed to classify Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. 

Dataset
Dataset: The Iris dataset consists of measurements of sepal and petal dimensions for three species of Iris flowers.
Preprocessing

Preprocessing:
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler is applied to normalize the input features to have zero mean and unit variance.
Target Encoding: Labels are encoded using LabelEncoder and then converted to categorical format using to_categorical.
Model Architecture

Architecture:
Input Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons and ReLU activation function.
Dropout Layer: Regularization technique with a dropout rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting.
Hidden Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons and ReLU activation function.
Output Layer: Dense layer with 3 neurons (one for each Iris species) and softmax activation function for multi-class classification.
Model Compilation

Compilation:
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is used for gradient-based optimization.
Loss Function: Categorical crossentropy, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
Metrics: Accuracy and a custom F1 score metric to evaluate model performance.
Training

Training:
Epochs: The model is trained for 40 epochs.
Batch Size: Mini-batch size of 10 samples per update.
Validation Split: 25% of the training data is used for validation during training.
Early Stopping: Training includes early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Evaluation
Evaluation:
Test Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated on the test set using accuracy and F1 score metrics.
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.

F1 Score: Balances precision and recall, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets or when all classes are not equally important.


Conclusion
This neural network model is designed to classify Iris flowers based on their physical characteristics. It uses a straightforward architecture with regularization and early stopping to optimize training and prevent overfitting. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 score provide insights into the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring robustness and reliability in real-world applications. Adjustments to hyperparameters or model architecture can further optimize performance based on specific requirements or further experimentation.
